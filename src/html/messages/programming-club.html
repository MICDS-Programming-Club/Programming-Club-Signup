<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">
	Hey {{firstName}}, welcome to the MICDS Programming Club!
	<br><br>
	We've got big things planned for Programming Club this year, and we're glad you're interested!
</p>

<h1 style="color: #d12229">Meeting</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">Programming Club will usually meet for the full activities period every Day 6, but we can also communicate via a messaginge service called Slack. <strong>You will receive another email with an invite to our Slack group, or alternatively, <a href="https://micdsprogrammingclub.slack.com">click here</a>. We strongly recommend you download Slack on your phone/computer to receive notifications and up-to-date information.</strong></p>

<h1 style="color: #d12229">Opportunities</h1>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h2>Drones</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">We finally got our <a href="https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/">Crazyflie drones</a> working, which we can use for our own <s>malicious</s> completely educational purposes! You may have seen these little guys flying around at Activities Fair! Make software that communicates with each drone to plan flight formations and interact with external input.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Web Development</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">The internet is one of the most powerful innovations we have at our fingertips. Leverage this amazing space and share your own ideas through the power of programming. This includes maintaining the student-run site, <a href="https://mymicds.net">MyMICDS.net</a>: a place to view your schedule, lunch, homework, bulletin, and more!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Videogame Development</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">What's a more productive waste of your time than making videogames? Using game engines like <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> or <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine</a>, make your ideas come to life.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>WWT Hackathon</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">Each year, a company called World Wide Technology (WWT) invites high schools in the Saint Louis area to a four-month-long competition to engineer a solution that addresses a problem in our community. <a href="https://github.com/michaelgira23/Pear-Tutoring">Last year</a>, the MICDS team won first place and $10,000 for our school!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Slack Bots</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">One of the most exciting parts of technology is interfacing it with humans. Make a chat bot that communicates via Slack to do anything you want from holding conversations to giving a summary of a Wikipedia page.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 1.25rem">If you have any other project ideas the Programming Club can do, contact one of the co-heads or sugguest it in the Slack group!</p>

There's a whole list of resources available on the Programming Club Guides, but here's a few websites to get you started:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h2>Codecademy</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 1.25rem"><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> has multiple courses taught through interactive coding challenges. It's completely free!</p>
