<p>
	<strong>Hey {{firstName}} {{lastName}}, welcome to the MICDS Programming Club!</strong>
	We've got big things planned for Programming Club this year, and we're glad you're interested!
</p>

<h1>Meeting</h1>
<p>Programming Club will usually meet for the full activities period every Day 6, but we can also communicate via an application called Slack. <a href="http://micdsprogrammingclub.slack.com/">Please click here to sign into our Slack group.</a> Slack is basically like Skype or Discord, which allows us to work on projects together outside of class.</p>

<h1>Projects We have in Mind</h1>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Play around with drones</h3>
		<p>Each member able to receive multiple <a href="https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/">free Crazyflie 2.0 drones</a>, which we can use for our own <s>malicious</s> completely educational purposes. This could include programming an autonomous drone swarm to do our bidding.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Inner-team Mini Hackathon Series / Competition</h3>
		<p>A hackathon is basically a coding competition. We could divide into teams and have competitions to create a product revolving around a certain theme.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Participate in Actual Hackathons</h3>
		<p>Outside of our own club, we can participate in public hackathons hosted by other organizations!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Work on MyMICDS.net</h3>
		<p>We can improve on our web development skills by developing and maintaining features for <a href="https://mymicds.net">MyMICDS.net</a>, a website aimed at gathering all the information you need into one place. You can input your schedule, view the lunch, use the digital planner, and more! This is a perfect opportunity for us to <s>exploit free child labor</s> practice our skills on a website people actually use!</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to Learn</h1>
<p>This year, we are probably going to be working with node.js and Python, possibly web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are lots of resources out there, but here are a few that we recommend:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Codecademy</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy.com</a> teaches a lot of languages, with interactive coding challenges. You are able to create an account for free!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Treehouse</h3>
		<p><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home">TeamTreehouse.com</a> offers a variety of courses created by expert teachers on web design, coding, business, and much more. You watch a series of videos and take quizzes and coding challenges to take after watching these videos. <strong>Treehouse required you to pay for an account, but we have a shared group account that Michael Gira pays for. (Username = '{{treehouseEmail}}', Password = '{{treehousePassword}}')</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>Contact</h1>
<p>If you got any questions, comments, or concerns, you can contact club sponsor <strong>Dr. Gaw (jgaw@micds.org)</strong> or club co-heads <strong>Bob Sforza (bsforza@micds.org)</strong> or <strong>Michael Gira (mgira@micds.org)</strong>.</p>
