**Hey {{firstName}} {{lastName}}, welcome to the MICDS Programming Club!**
We've got big things planned for Programming Club this year, and we're glad you're interested!

# Meeting
Programming Club will usually meet for the full activities period every Day 6, but we can also communicate via an application called Slack. **You will receive another email with an invite to our Slack group shortly.** Slack is basically like Skype or Discord, which allows us to work on projects together outside of class.

# Projects We have in Mind

## Play around with drones
Each member able to receive multiple [free Crazyflie 2.0 drones](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/), which we can use for our own ~~malicious~~ completely educational purposes. This could include programming an autonomous drone swarm to do our bidding.</p>

## Inner-team Mini Hackathon Series / Competition
A hackathon is basically a coding competition. We could divide into teams and have competitions to create a product revolving around a certain theme.

## Participate in Actual Hackathons
Outside of our own club, we can participate in public hackathons hosted by other organizations!

## Work on MyMICDS.net
We can improve on our web development skills by developing and maintaining features for [MyMICDS.net](https://mymicds.net), a website aimed at gathering all the information you need into one place. You can input your schedule, view the lunch, use the digital planner, and more! This is a perfect opportunity for us to ~~exploit free child labor~~ practice our skills on a website people actually use!

# Contact
If you got any questions, comments, or concerns, you can contact club sponsor **Dr. Gaw (jgaw@micds.org)** or club co-heads **Bob Sforza (bsforza@micds.org)** or **Michael Gira (mgira@micds.org)**.
